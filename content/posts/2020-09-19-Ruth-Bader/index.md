"Some people come and simply make an impact that lasts forever.”

Hey everyone, today I am going to talk about Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( RGB ). I got to know about her at the beginning of the year 2020 when I watched the movie “On the Basis of Sex (2018)". She was an associate justice of the Supreme Court (USA) since 1993-2020. This movie talks about her case and the broader struggle for equal rights for men and women in America. She just wanted to make clear that there should be no such thing as women's work or men's work.

I researched and read about her a lot. Simply because she was an amazing personality. I am not a law student, but I love reading about history, and people so I will share some of my takeaways :

### Amazing work (NO MATTER WHAT):

In 1957, Martin D. Ginsburg ( RGB’s husband) was diagnosed with testicular cancer. During his illness and treatment—surgery followed by radiation—Ruth not only cared for him, and the baby, but also covered all of his classes and helped him with his papers. She kept up an almost inhuman schedule, often working through the night. No matter what you have to do and work for the best! I realised this in a hard way. She taught us in the world of chaos and pseudo feminism that one should make their existence worthwhile with their work.

### Supportive partner:

Martin D. Ginsburg was a husband of RGB. It is not so easy to support your partner truly. It is too easy to say that we will support the other person in their dreams, struggles, etc. but when reality hits you, all kind of emotions (anger, resentment, envy, patriarchy, etc.) can come, or you can simply back out.
But this person(Martin) was terrific! We rarely witness people like this.

### Ginsburg won her most significant victories by helping men understand that sexism hurts them too:

Ginsburg often said about the client Stephen Wiesenfeld, a stay-at-home father. The latter successfully challenged a law that denied widowers benefits that Wiesenfeld would have received if he were a woman that lost her husband. Her way and methods to make the jury understand about equality were different, and yes, that's why her voice has reformed the world to a better place.
